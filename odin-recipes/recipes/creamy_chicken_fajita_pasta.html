    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chicken fajita pasta dish has all the flavors of classic Mexican chicken fajitas. It's easy to make in one pot for a fantastic midweek dinner!</p>
    <p>This recipe is like it sounds: chicken fajitas dressed in penne pasta. But this recipe is far from just that. The
    chicken is made with an array of seasonings—chili powder, onion and garlic powder, cumin, salt, and oregano—while the
    sauce is a mixture of milk, chicken broth, and salsa. The cherry on top? It’s all made in one pot.</p>

        <li>
            ¼ cup minced cilantro
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine chili powder, cumin, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and Mexican oregano in a small bowl for the seasoning blend. Season chicken with half of the seasoning; reserve remaining seasoning for later.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add chicken strips and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat remaining oil in the same pot. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in 1 cup chicken broth and salsa, scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add milk and dry pasta to the pot and stir to combine. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Add chicken and bell peppers on top and bring to a boil. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce heat to a light simmer and cook, gently stirring every 4 to 5 minutes, until pasta is cooked through and sauce has thickened, about 20 minutes. Try and keep noodles as submerged as possible while cooking. If the consistency becomes too thick, add a bit more chicken broth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season with remaining seasoning blend, to taste. Stir in Mexican cheese and combine until melted. Sprinkle with cilantro to serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
